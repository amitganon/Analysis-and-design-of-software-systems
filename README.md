# Analysis-and-design-of-software-systems

Language: Java

Analysis, design and implementation of a supermarket system, called "Super-Lee". The supermarket system manages employees, trucking, inventory, branches, and suppliers of the supermarket.
Project with 8 students, each pair received a modul. At each stage of the project we integrate the models.
During the project the customer adds and changes his requirements, and in fact we are required to design in a modular and balanced way in the time ratio given to us.
In addition to the implementation there are very detailed analysis and design charts for all phases of the project: customer requirements, DFD, department charts and more.
