# Analysis-and-design-of-software-systems

Language: Java

Analysis, design, and implementation of a supermarket system, called "Super-Lee". The supermarket system manages employees, trucks, inventory, branches, and suppliers. Project with 8 students. Each pair received a module. At each stage of the project, we integrate the models. As the project progresses, the customer's requirements change, so we have to design in a modular and balanced manner within the given timeframe. In addition to implementation, there are detailed analysis and design charts for all phases of the project: customer requirements, DFD, department charts, and more.
